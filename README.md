# Upstream
Upstream is an innovative project that aims to recreate the functionality of an analog computer. 
This project is not just about replicating the past, but also about understanding the principles 
of analog computing and how it can be applied in the modern world.

The project involves the design and construction of a fully functional analog computer, using 
traditional analog components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and inductors. The 
goal is to create a machine that can perform complex calculations and solve problems that were 
previously only possible with digital computers, or not even calculatable until now.

The Upstream project is not just about the hardware. It also involves the software, which is 
designed to control and operate the analog computer. The software is written in a low-level 
language, similar to the assembly language used in early computers, to ensure maximum control 
over the hardware.

The Upstream project is a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of its developers. It's a 
project that combines the past and the future, and it's a project that pushes the boundaries of 
what's possible with analog computing.
